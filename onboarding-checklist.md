## New User Tasks


### 1. Join the HumanCellAtlas GitHub Organization 

If you do not currently have a GitHub account, please create one. GitHub accounts must either be associated with the institutional email address (e.g. @chanzuckerburg.com, @broadinstitute.org, @ebi.ac.uk) or the GitHub profile must positively identify you by first and last name. You must configure your GitHub account to meet DCP requirements which include 1) enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) and 2) configuring git-secrets. Failure to adhere to these requirements at any time will result in the unannounced removal of your GitHub account from the HumanCellAtlas GitHub organization. 

After creating your account, please perform the following steps:
1. Enable 2FA according to [GitHub Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication). 

2. [Configure git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets), a tool to help prevent secrets from being committed in code. 

### 2. Review Required Onboarding Documentation. 

Please complete the four listed tasks. Note that your Security Lead will make you a "New User Onboarding" GitHub ticket. When you have completed the tasks below, acknowledge task completion by updating your "New User Onboarding" GitHub ticket.

1. Read and accept the [values of the HCA org](https://sites.google.com/broadinstitute.org/hca-dcp-org#h.p_cpYm-5DoqRcp). 

2. Complete the [DCP tutorial](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/dcp/blob/master/DCP_Tutorial.md).

3. Complete the Human Cell Atlas [Security Training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RwPSSVNh3uGw5yWl6BDDZiH17V1ov7IHmGv0B0GgM4s/edit#slide=id.g37371b00f1_0_186).

4. Review best practices for storing secrets in the [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).


### 3. Join the HCA Slack Organization

Go [here](https://join-hca-slack.data.humancellatlas.org/) to obtain an invitation to join the HumanCellAtlas Slack. Use your institutional email address to join. If you are new to slack, be aware that some channels are public and some are private. Keep this discrepancy in mind when posting information. Add yourself to the following channels:

*    #dcp (public channel)
*    #dcp-ops-help (private channel)
*    #dcp-meeting-digest (public channel: summarizes meetings after they occur)

Your team may suggest other channels to join.

### 4. Add Name to the HCA DCP Roster Spreadsheet

Update the [HCA DCP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0RGNrEYsIOYYg9TRKK0dJgq_MDVKnrAnzPRvQqGLec/edit#gid=0) roster spreadsheet by adding your information to a new row in the “Core Implementation” tab.


### 5. Add Bio to the HCA Bio Document 

Update [HCA Bio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gwrn2KgGGiEV37g0vhWnBrGLRvAPp-xXgq569R5WuPY/edit?usp=sharing) by adding a new entry that includes your institutional affiliation, role, a short biography, and headshot.

### 6. Join the DCP Calendar

To subscribe to the DCP calendar from your google calendar, use the calendar's [public URL](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=broadinstitute.org_3k1lsin0pb4utgg8d87plnhcc8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).

### 7. Review Team Technical Documentation

Technical Lead (or designee) will advise you on what documentation should be reviewed. At a minimum, this includes the contributing pages for the repositories in which you will be working.

### 8. Review Useful Acronyms

There are many acronyms within the HCA and analysis community! Fortunately, there are also many docs to help you learn them! Check out the [HCA glossary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KaRWiAIVs5BETqwhQ7BI0B65EWSjCmw-RlbGdSjKLGI/edit#gid=0).
